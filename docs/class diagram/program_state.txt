✅ What is ProgramState used for?

1. Admin authority (governance)
admin_pubkey gives you a single on-chain authority that controls privileged operations.
Examples of admin-only actions:
pausing the program
disabling product registration temporarily
migrating data
upgrading the program in a controlled way
emergency revocation of counterfeit batches


2. Versioning for upgrades
version: u8 stores the program version on-chain so your app knows:
Which API version the program is running
Whether an upgrade has occurred
Whether clients should use new or old metadata formats
Why?
Solana programs evolve. When you upgrade and change struct layouts or behaviors, mobile apps must recognize that.
if program.version < 2:
    // old metadata parsing
else:
    // new metadata rules
